# Shake

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ndmitchell/shake.png)](https://travis-ci.org/ndmitchell/shake)

Shake is a library for writing build systems - designed as a replacement for make. Shake lets you write large robust build systems, which deal properly with generated source files and run quickly.
